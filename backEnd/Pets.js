    story:"Did you know there are THREE D's in dog??? No, seriously!!! I have two of them already :) I am Dee Dee and I am the former girlfriend of Dennis, and the mom of Donna. The three of us were left like bags of trash you don't want after you move to a new home... We were left all alone in our backyard by our \"family\".... Fast Forward to today, we are SO SO HAPPY they left us behind!!! NO MORE babies for me, Donna too! And Dennis has a new girlfriend who can't make babies either, but he doesn't care!!! I am FREEEEEEEEEE I have a bully dog personality, with a little boxer mixed in there for fun. I am a medium sized girl, only 43 pounds when spayed. My old flame, Dennis, may actually be my brother (EWWWWWWW) as he looks very American Bulldog too. And Donna could be our \"love child\", ARGGGGHHHHHHHHHH But all kidding aside, I am a really neat girl, active is a good description. I would love to have a family who will take me out to all kinds of cool places, who will love me as the happy girl I am and wear me out daily. I can be picky about my other friends, but do get along with some of the dogs here, I would be good as an only dog or with another dog I like (mostly other males). We can hang on the couch, play in the yard or nap in the sun- whatever you like, I am down with it!!!! Local adoption is $200 (in TX) Out of state adoption fee is $400 (includes transport to your area included)"
